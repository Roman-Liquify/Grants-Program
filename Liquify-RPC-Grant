## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Liquify.io Grant Proposal to Web3Foundation

**About us**
Founded in 2021, Liquify LTD is a UK based bare metal Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) company servicing institutions and foundations with nodes, validators, RPC endpoints, snapshots, Graphs nodes, monitoring solutions and other custom tools. 
Our utmost focus is decentralisation and quality of service - we go the extra mile being fully bare metal running all our own infrastructure in tier 3 and 4 data centres spread out globally (Asia, US East and West, and Europe).

**Motivation**
The industry is still heavily cloud reliant and centralised across cloud infrastructure providers and major market players. 
Liquify is one of a few fully bare metal providers powering all decentralised RPC networks, rocking a global set up and guaranteeing 99.95% uptime. Our vision is to drive decentralisation with high quality of service, reliability and scalability.

**Goals**
We want to support Polkadot ecosystem and community with high performance RPC endpoints and drive adoption by adding it to our RPC portal which is focused on decentralisation and will feature majority of decentralised RPC protocols starting with POKT, Lava, DIN, Arkeo etc.

### Project Details

Scope of the grant.
Provision of Polkadot nodes including:
- 3 dedicated RPC endpoints (hosted in the US, EU, Asia);
- 1 dedicated archival RPC endpoint;
- Connected to geomeshing and load balancer;
- Fallback infrastructure with 99.95% uptime guaranteed in the SLA;
- Access to the monitoring dashboard.
- Adding Polkadot RPC endpoint to Liquify RPC Portal, currently in BETA, which will also have a decentralised toggle for routing traffic via POKT Network.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- We can see ourselves as one of the main RPC providers of the ecosystem supporting the community with stable, fast and reliable infrastructure while offering decentralised option.

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- Developers.

- What need(s) does your project meet?
- User adoption, performance, decentralisation, cost efficiency and network growth.

- How did you identify these needs? Please provide evidence in the form of (scientific) articles, forum discussions, case studies, or raw data.
- We can see this naturally since we support over 60 networks, cloud reliance limits the redundancy and we could see performance improvements (better latency since we are multiregion), better uptime (because of the redundancy) etc.

- Are there any projects similar to yours in related ecosystems? 
- Yes, we can see RPC service provided by OnFinality, Dwellir, Pinknode, Radium Block, 1RPC, NOWNodes, All That Node, SubQuery.
We contribute with offering more regions, redundancy, bare metal set up and uptime guarantees + decentralised connection via our Portal.
